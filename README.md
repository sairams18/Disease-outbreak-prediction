Disease Outbreak Prediction Project - Complete Overview

This project aims to predict disease outbreaks based on environmental, demographic, and healthcare-related factors. It leverages machine learning models and clustering techniques to categorize risk levels and make predictions.

üîπ Technologies Used & Their Purpose
The project involves multiple technologies and libraries, each serving a specific function:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Python üêç (Core Programming Language)
Used for data processing, analysis, and machine learning.
Provides flexibility, scalability, and a rich ecosystem for AI/ML applications.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Handling & Processing
Technology	Purpose
Pandas (import pandas as pd)	Data manipulation, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
NumPy (import numpy as np)	Efficient numerical operations, mathematical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import seaborn as sns)	Data visualization (correlation heatmaps, feature importance).

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Technology	Purpose
Scikit-Learn (sklearn.preprocessing)	Standardizing features using StandardScaler() for normalization.
LabelEncoder	Converts categorical variables into numerical format.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning & Clustering
Technology	Purpose
Scikit-Learn (sklearn.ensemble)	Uses RandomForestClassifier() to make predictions.
Scikit-Learn (sklearn.cluster)	Uses KMeans & DBSCAN for clustering outbreak risk levels.
K-Means Clustering (KMeans(n_clusters=3))

Categorizes regions into low, medium, and high risk based on data patterns.
Works well for large datasets with clear cluster separation. 
DBSCAN Clustering (DBSCAN(eps=0.5, min_samples=5)) Used for smaller datasets with noisy data. Identifies outliers in risk categorization.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Evaluation
Technology	Purpose
Train-Test Split	Splits the dataset into training and testing sets (80-20).
Random Forest Classifier (RandomForestClassifier())	Predicts outbreak risks based on historical data.
SMOTE & Random Undersampling (imbalanced-learn)	Balances the dataset by handling class imbalances.
Performance Metrics (sklearn.metrics)	Evaluates model accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC score.
accuracy_score() ‚Üí Measures how often predictions are correct.
f1_score() ‚Üí Handles class imbalance by considering both precision and recall.
roc_auc_score() ‚Üí Evaluates multi-class classification performance.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization & Insights
Technology	Purpose
Matplotlib & Seaborn	Plots feature importance, correlation heatmaps.
Color-coded Heatmap	Visualizes relationships between variables.
Feature Importance Analysis	Identifies the most impactful factors in outbreak prediction.
